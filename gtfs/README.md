# GTFS

This directory contains the programs used to download PTV's gtfs.zip file and extract it into a PostgreSQL database.

Prior to running the scripts, you will need to create the vic_db database and the schemas and tables within it. 

To create the database, run the create-db.bat file in the parent directory outside of this gtfs directory.

To create the schemas and tables, run the create-gtfs.sql file in this gtfs directory. The create-gtfs.sql file is generated by the gen-sql.py script.

To download the gtfs.zip file, run the following command in PowerShell:
```powershell
.\download-gtfs.ps1
```

To download the gtfs.zip file AND extract it into a PostgreSQL database, run the following command in PowerShell:
```powershell
.\download-gtfs.ps1 -db
```
